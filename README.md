## Overview
BookManager is used for managing personal books.   
To use BookManager, the first step is to input an ISBN. Then the program will search the corresponding book automatically. After the search is completed, you can add the book to a database.  
There are still some functions to be achieved, including marking books as “wanna read” or "have read", adding comments and so on.  
The program is written in C++ and Qt. MySQL (or SQLite) is used as DBMS.
